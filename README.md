## Explanation

It's interesting to see that most other countries i.e. Turkey, Belgium and France that previously had a spike in their confirmed cases began to see a decrease from the month of March except th eUS, Spain and Italy who still had a spike up to end of the month of April.

With current data, Spain and Italy have seen a huge decrease but the cases in the US continues to keep rising.
